Everyday Habits That Reveal an Extremely Low IQ (Backed by Psychology) 
You ever meet someone who argues confidently but makes zero sense? They're loud, certain, and absolutely wrong. Well, psychology says that might not just be arrogance. It could actually be a sign of low intelligence. Let's talk about the real sciencebacked signs of an extremely low IQ. One, overconfidence without understanding.
Psychologists call this the Dunning Krueger effect. It's when people with low ability overestimate their skills. They don't know enough to realize how much they don't know. So, they speak with confidence. But when you dig deeper, there's no logic behind their words. Two, no curiosity or desire to learn. One of the biggest signs of intelligence is curiosity. Smart people ask why.

They struggle to handle complexity, nuance, or multiple perspectives. Four, poor emotional control. Studies show that low IQ often comes with low emotional intelligence. They react impulsively, get offended easily, and can't regulate anger or frustration.

It means they believe life happens to them not because of them. They blame luck, people or society for their problems instead of taking responsibility or finding solutions.
Six, can't handle opposing opinions. Low IQ individuals often confuse disagreement with disrespect. When someone challenges their views, they take it personally instead of logically because debating requires reasoning. And reasoning takes cognitive effort they can't handle. Low IQ isn't just about bad grades or lack of education.
It's about how someone thinks. And the scary part, many people never realize it. Because the lower your IQ, the less you see your own flaws.
