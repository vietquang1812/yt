control worker and completely out of shape one day he saw a Navy sealed documentary and something clicked he decided to turn his life around the problem he had to lose over 100 lb in 3 months to even qualify for Seal training so what did he do he went all in woke up at 400 a.m. ran miles every day pushed himself past limits that should have been impossible did it hurt hell yeah did he want to quit every single day but he didn't because he understood that mental toughness is built in the moments when you want to stop but don't fast
forward he became one of the toughest endurance athletes in the world broke world records and pro that the human mind is capable of insane things and that's the truth your limits they're mostly in your head section two stop doing these three things if you want to be mentally strong stop doing these three things immediately stop complaining complaining doesn't fix anything it just keeps you stuck either fix it or accept it and move on simple stop seeking comfort growth happens in discomfort you want to be strong push yourself into situations

take a deep breath count to five this tiny habit gives you power over your emotions instead of letting them run your life emotions are like waves they come and go but if you let them dictate your actions you'll never be in control section five learn to embrace failure most people are terrified of failure but the truth is failure is a requirement for Success you can't grow if you never fail the best athletes entrepreneurs and leaders have failed more times than most people have even tried if you failed recently good that means you're trying
that means you're learning the only real failure is quitting section seven develop an unshakable attitude the strongest people don't let external events shake them they stay calm focused and in control no matter what happens life is unpredictable one moment everything is going smoothly and the next you're blindsided by something unexpected failure loss bet betrayal disappointment but here's what separates the strong from the weak mentally strong people don't crumble when things go wrong they adapt they adjust they keep
